So my project is the website for a new startup "chocolate coveered goodness."  

The idea for the project's services are that I will have a premade selections page where users select from products and it' adds them to their cart. 
A login service to save your status and infornmation. 
A custom creation where you define the exact bag of chocolate that you want then add it to the cart. 
And an event recomendations page where the porportions of chocolate goodiebags for your event are generated for you, then automatically added to the cart.

I was origionally planning on making the database store user's custom creations in a different table and have that pulled in a different page that lets them select their favorites but I didnt get around to it.


For the login feel free to make your own, or use user: "John", pass: "Cena".
